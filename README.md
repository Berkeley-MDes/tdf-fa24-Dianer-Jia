# Week 1: Report 1

## Week of 09/05/2024

This week, as someone who has never used Rhino before, I downloaded Rhino and started to learn how to use it. I took Dave Schultze's Rhino 7 Essential Training course on LinkedIn to learn some basics about Rhino.
I familiarized myself with Rhino's user interface and navigation tools, and then further started experimenting with some simple 2D and 3D graphics.

On top of that, learn some tranformation tools like move, rotate, etc.

I also explored some knowledge about curves, such as creating 2D graphics on curves

Also the use of freeform

Immediately after that, I learned about some basic surface modeling.
For example, modeling strategies with extruding curves

This is the first time I've created a 3D model with two shapes, and it was a lot of fun!
I also learned lofting surfaces

That's just part of what I'm learning. I think Rhino is a great software to explore. I come from a fashion design background, and during my undergraduate years I learned to use clo3d to model clothing. In the process of learning Rhino, I have discovered that the two softwares have some things in common, but Rhino is more widely used and has more attention to detail. I will keep learning some new Rhino skills every week and train more until I am proficient in this software.

Also I tried laser cut today! Though everything didn't go as smooth as I think (the machine I reserved was out of order and the maker pass didn't go through that quick), I still made it!

# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

It's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions, make a copy.  Also, feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

Excited to work with you,
your TDF teaching team

PS: let us know if you have any questions!!
